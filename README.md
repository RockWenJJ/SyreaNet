## Overview
![overall_arch](./figs/fig-overall_arch.png)
The overall architecture of our method. Specifically, synthetic underwater images are first generated by our proposed physically guided synthesis module (PGSM). Then, various synthetic and real underwater images are fed into the physically guided disentangled network, predicting the clear image, backscattering, transmission and white point. The intra- and inter- Domain Adaptations are done by exchanging the knowledge across attribute domains.

Enhancement examples under various underwater conditions. Video can be found at [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyOktx7_9JQ).


## Dataset
The synthesis and real-world dataset could be downloaded via:
[[BaiduYun]](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1iVAR_hSVmLMyrWcjm4HbbA) (Code:90gv)

## Synthesize Underwater Images
```shell
cd synthesize
python synthesize.py --image-dir <Path-To-InAir-Images> --depth-dir <Path-To-Depth-Maps> --out-dir <Output-Directory>
```
Note: To synthesize underwater images, in-air images and their corresponding depth maps are required.

## Test with Real Underwater Images
First, please download the pretrained checkpoint in [[GoogleDrive]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xGrq2jMpdM4mbgDfS4K_cfaeRiEqcgjZ/view?usp=sharing) [[BaiduYun]](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1x9x41K55j54D_2NmuEM4mQ) (Code:s8wq). After that, put the pretrained checkpoint in `checkpoints`.

For demo, just install the required packages with ``pip install -r requirements``. And then run
```shell
python test.py --config ./configs/syreanet_test.yaml --load-path ./checkpoints/pretrained.pth
```
The enhanced results of images in `samples` will be found in `output`.

For testing your own images, change the data_path `configs/syreanet_test.yaml` to the directory of your images. And run
```shell
python test.py --config ./configs/syreanet_test.yaml --load-path ./checkpoints/pretrained.pth --output-dir <YOUR_OUT_DIR>
```
The enhanced results will be found in `<YOUR_OUT_DIR>`.
